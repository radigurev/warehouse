## 0. Active Personas & Workflow

### Execution Pipeline

```
spec-writer → implementator → tester → spec-validator → isa95-validator
```

| Phase | Persona Category | Base Persona | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Spec Writer** | `~/.claude/personas/spec-writer/` | `doc-governance.md` | Write or update the SDD specification before any code is written |
| **2. Implementator** | `~/.claude/personas/implementator/` | `csharp-persona.md` | Write production-ready code that fulfills the specification |
| **3. Tester** | `~/.claude/personas/tester/` | `csharp-persona.md` | Write tests that verify the implementation matches the specification |
| **4. Spec Validator** | `~/.claude/personas/validator/` | `doc-governance.md` | Validate that the spec, code, and tests are all in sync |
| **5. ISA-95 Validator** | `.claude/agents/isa95-validate.md` (local) | `CLAUDE.md` §1.1 | Validate ISA-95 compliance of entities, operations, specs, and domain boundaries |

### ISA-95 Validator (Phase 5 — local agent)

| Concern | Agent File |
|---|---|
| ISA-95 compliance validation | `.claude/agents/isa95-validate.md` |

The ISA-95 validator is a **project-local agent** (not global). It validates new and existing work against the ISA-95 (IEC 62264) standard as defined in Sections 1.1–1.1.7 of this file. It checks:

1. **Entity Classification** — all entities classified under ISA-95 object model (Section 1.1.3)
2. **Activity Model Alignment** — operations mapped to ISA-95 activity functions (Section 1.1.4)
3. **Spec ISA-95 References** — SDD specs reference applicable ISA-95 part/section (Rule 3)
4. **Equipment Hierarchy** — Enterprise → Site → Area → Storage Unit respected (Rule 4)
5. **Material Traceability** — Definition → Lot → Sublot chain maintained (Rule 5)
6. **Movement Reason Codes** — aligned with ISA-95 base types (Rule 6, Section 1.1.6.1)
7. **Domain Boundaries** — microservices map to single ISA-95 domain (Rule 8)
8. **Immutable Events** — state-changing operations produce immutable records (Rule 10)
9. **Terminology Compliance** — names prefer ISA-95 terms, grandfathered exceptions noted (Rule 7)

The local pipeline (`.claude/agents/pipeline.md`) orchestrates all 5 phases.

### Implementator Personas

| Concern | Persona File |
|---|---|
| Base code standards | `~/.claude/personas/csharp-persona.md` |
| .NET 8 REST Microservices | `~/.claude/personas/implementator/persona-dotnet8-microservices.md` |
| Database (EF Core, migrations) | `~/.claude/personas/implementator/persona-database.md` |
| MongoDB (if added later) | `~/.claude/personas/implementator/persona-mongodb.md` |

### Tester Personas

| Concern | Persona File |
|---|---|
| Base (always-on) | `~/.claude/personas/tester/tester-base.md` |
| EF Core / ORM tests | `~/.claude/personas/tester/tester-ef-orm.md` |
| API integration tests | `~/.claude/personas/tester/tester-integration.md` |

## 0.1 Project Policies (override persona defaults)

- **Target framework:** .NET 8.0
- **Error responses:** ProblemDetails (RFC 7807)
- **Polly:** Required on all outbound HTTP clients (to be added when services are implemented)
- **Mapping:** AutoMapper only
- **Logging:** NLog with structured message templates
- **ORM:** EF Core with separate DbContext per domain (AuthDbContext, CustomersDbContext, InventoryDbContext)
- **Validation:** FluentValidation
- **PK strategy:** INT IDENTITY (or GUID with `NEWSEQUENTIALID()` if GUID is chosen)
- **API versioning:** URL-based (`/api/v1/`)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based with RBAC (implemented in Warehouse.Auth.API)
- **Frontend:** Vue.js 3 SPA (Single Page Application) with Composition API, TypeScript, Vue Router, Pinia state management

### Configuration File Policy

-   **Only `.template` files are tracked in git.** Real `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.*.json`, `app.config`, and `web.config` files are gitignored.
-   Template files use `<PLACEHOLDER>` values for all sensitive data (connection strings, API keys, secrets).
-   When adding a new config key, update the corresponding `.template` file with a placeholder.
-   Never commit real connection strings, passwords, API keys, or tokens.
-   Developers copy `appsettings.json.template` → `appsettings.json` locally and fill in real values.

## 0.2 Specification Alignment Gate

Before implementing any task, check alignment with existing specifications:

- `docs/core/SDD-*.md` — Core business pipeline
- `docs/domain/SDD-*.md` — Domain capabilities
- `docs/integration/SDD-*.md` — External integrations
- `docs/infrastructure/SDD-*.md` — Cross-cutting concerns

If a request is outside scope, contradicts a spec, or is ambiguous — **STOP and clarify**.

---

## 1. Project Purpose

Warehouse Management System (WMS) — a monorepo containing .NET 8 backend microservices and a Vue.js Single Page Application (SPA) frontend. The system manages warehouse operations including inventory, storage locations, inbound/outbound shipments, and related workflows. **The system is designed to conform to the ISA-95 (IEC 62264) standard** for enterprise–operations integration.

**Architecture:** Monorepo with multiple backend microservices sharing common libraries, and a single Vue.js SPA frontend that consumes the backend REST APIs.

---

## 1.1 ISA-95 Standard Compliance (IEC 62264)

This project follows the **ISA-95 / IEC 62264** international standard for integrating enterprise and control systems. ISA-95 compliance is an **architectural policy** — all domain modeling, entity naming, operations design, and future feature planning MUST align with the ISA-95 object and activity models.

### 1.1.1 ISA-95 Hierarchy Placement

| ISA-95 Level | Description | WMS Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Level 4** | Business Planning & Logistics | ERP integration (future), customer orders, purchasing |
| **Level 3** | Manufacturing Operations Management | **This WMS** — Inventory Operations, Warehouse Execution |
| Level 2 | Monitoring & Supervisory Control | Barcode scanning, IoT sensors (future) |
| Level 1 | Sensing & Manipulation | Equipment controllers (out of scope) |
| Level 0 | Physical Process | Physical equipment (out of scope) |

This WMS primarily operates at **Level 3** (Operations Management) with Level 4 interfaces planned for ERP integration.

### 1.1.2 ISA-95 Operations Domains

| ISA-95 Domain | Status | WMS Microservice | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory Operations** | Active | `Warehouse.Inventory.API` | Material tracking, movements, adjustments, stocktaking, transfers |
| **Personnel & Authorization** | Active | `Warehouse.Auth.API` | Personnel, roles, qualifications, audit |
| **Business Partner Management** | Active | `Warehouse.Customers.API` | Customers, accounts, contacts |
| **Production Operations** | Planned | Future: `Warehouse.Production.API` | Production orders, work orders, scheduling |
| **Quality Operations** | Planned | Future: `Warehouse.Quality.API` | Inspections, quality holds, certifications |
| **Procurement Operations** | Planned | Future: `Warehouse.Purchasing.API` | Purchase orders, inbound shipments, supplier management |
| **Fulfillment Operations** | Planned | Future: `Warehouse.Fulfillment.API` | Sales orders, picking, packing, outbound shipments |
| **Maintenance Operations** | Out of scope | — | Equipment maintenance |

### 1.1.3 ISA-95 Object Model — Terminology Mapping

All entity naming and domain concepts follow the ISA-95 object model. This mapping is the **canonical reference** for how WMS entities relate to the standard.

#### Material Model (ISA-95 Part 2, Section 7)

| ISA-95 Term | WMS Entity | DB Table | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Material Definition | `Product` | `inventory.Products` | Master data defining what a material is |
| Material Class | `ProductCategory` | `inventory.ProductCategories` | Hierarchical classification of materials |
| Material Lot | `Batch` | `inventory.Batches` | Tracked quantity with shared properties (expiry, manufacturing date) |
| Material Sublot | — | — | Not yet implemented — subdivision of lots for finer traceability |
| Unit of Measure | `UnitOfMeasure` | `inventory.UnitsOfMeasure` | Standard measurement units (kg, pcs, L, etc.) |
| Bill of Material | `BillOfMaterials` | `inventory.BillOfMaterials` | Recipe/formula definition (parent product) |
| BOM Component | `BomLine` | `inventory.BomLines` | Component line within a BOM (child product + quantity) |
| Alternate Material | `ProductSubstitute` | `inventory.ProductSubstitutes` | Interchangeable material definition |
| Related Material | `ProductAccessory` | `inventory.ProductAccessories` | Associated/complementary material |

#### Equipment Model (ISA-95 Part 2, Section 5)

| ISA-95 Term | WMS Entity | DB Table | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enterprise | — | — | Organization level (implicit — single-tenant system) |
| Site | `WarehouseEntity` | `inventory.Warehouses` | Physical warehouse facility |
| Area | `Zone` | `inventory.Zones` | Functional subdivision within a site |
| Storage Zone | `Zone` | `inventory.Zones` | ISA-95 storage zone maps to WMS Zone |
| Storage Unit | `StorageLocation` | `inventory.StorageLocations` | Addressable position (Row, Shelf, Bin, Bulk) |
| Work Center | — | — | Not applicable — no production execution yet |
| Work Unit | — | — | Not applicable — no production execution yet |

#### Personnel Model (ISA-95 Part 2, Section 6)

| ISA-95 Term | WMS Entity | DB Table | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Person | `User` | `auth.Users` | Individual operator/user identity |
| Personnel Class | `Role` | `auth.Roles` | Role-based classification of personnel |
| Qualification | `Permission` | `auth.Permissions` | Specific capability/authorization (resource:action) |
| Credential | `RefreshToken` | `auth.RefreshTokens` | Authentication credential |

#### Operations Event Model

| ISA-95 Term | WMS Entity | DB Table | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Operations Event | `UserActionLog` | `auth.UserActionLogs` | Immutable audit record of operations |
| Stock Event | `StockMovement` | `inventory.StockMovements` | Immutable record of material quantity change |
| Inventory Count | `StocktakeSession` | `inventory.StocktakeSessions` | Physical inventory count event |
| Count Record | `StocktakeCount` | `inventory.StocktakeCounts` | Individual product count entry |

### 1.1.4 ISA-95 Inventory Operations Activity Model (Part 3)

This maps ISA-95 activity model functions to WMS implementation.

| ISA-95 Activity | WMS Concept | Controller / Service | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Inventory Definition Management** | Product/Category/UOM CRUD | `ProductsController`, `ProductCategoriesController`, `UnitsOfMeasureController` | Implemented |
| **Material Inventory Tracking** | StockLevel per product/location/batch | `StockLevelsController` | Implemented |
| **Inventory Counting** | StocktakeSession + StocktakeCount | `StocktakeSessionsController`, `StocktakeCountsController` | Implemented |
| **Inventory Adjustment** | Approval workflow (Pending → Approved → Applied) | `InventoryAdjustmentsController` | Implemented |
| **Material Movement** | Immutable StockMovement records with reason codes | `StockMovementsController` | Implemented |
| **Material Transfer** | Inter-site transfer (Draft → Completed) | `WarehouseTransfersController` | Implemented |
| **Material Receipt** | Inbound shipment processing | — | Planned |
| **Material Shipment** | Outbound shipment processing | — | Planned |
| **Material Storage** | Location assignment and management | `StorageLocationsController` | Implemented |
| **Production Resource Management** | BOM/recipe definition | `BillOfMaterialsController` | Catalog only |

### 1.1.5 ISA-95 Information Exchange (Part 4 — Future)

When implementing ERP integration, the information exchange MUST follow ISA-95 Part 4 patterns:

| Exchange Type | Direction | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Material Definition Download | ERP → WMS | Product master data | Sync material definitions from enterprise |
| Inventory Report | WMS → ERP | Stock levels by site/material | Periodic or on-demand inventory visibility |
| Material Movement Report | WMS → ERP | Movement transactions | Immutable event stream of stock changes |
| Production Order | ERP → WMS | Work order + BOM | Future: production execution |
| Shipment Request | ERP → WMS | Outbound order lines | Future: pick/pack/ship instructions |
| Receipt Confirmation | WMS → ERP | Inbound receipt details | Future: goods receipt posting |

The data format SHOULD follow B2MML (Business to Manufacturing Markup Language) or an equivalent JSON schema derived from ISA-95 object models.

### 1.1.6 ISA-95 Compliance Policy Rules

These rules are **MANDATORY** for all new development:

1.  **Entity Classification** — All new entities MUST be classified under an ISA-95 object model category (Material, Equipment, Personnel, or Operations Event). Add the mapping to the terminology table in this section.
2.  **Activity Model Alignment** — All new operations/endpoints MUST be mapped to an ISA-95 activity model function. If no matching function exists, document the extension rationale.
3.  **Spec References** — SDD specifications MUST reference the applicable ISA-95 part and section in their Context block (e.g., "Conforms to ISA-95 Part 2 Section 7 — Material Model").
4.  **Equipment Hierarchy** — The ISA-95 hierarchy (Enterprise → Site → Area → Work Center) MUST be respected. Do not introduce equipment entities that violate this hierarchy.
5.  **Material Traceability** — Material tracking MUST maintain the ISA-95 chain: Material Definition → Material Lot → Material Sublot. Do not bypass lot tracking for traceable materials.
6.  **Movement Types** — Stock movements MUST use ISA-95 aligned reason codes: Receipt, Shipment, Transfer, Adjustment, Count Adjustment, Production Consumption, Production Output.
7.  **Terminology Preference** — When naming new entities, properties, or API resources, PREFER ISA-95 terminology where it does not conflict with already-established WMS naming conventions. Existing entity names are grandfathered and do NOT need renaming.
8.  **Domain Boundaries** — New microservices MUST align with an ISA-95 operations domain. Do not create services that span multiple operations domains.
9.  **Information Exchange** — Future ERP/MES integration MUST follow ISA-95 Part 4 information exchange patterns. Do not design proprietary integration schemas without documenting the ISA-95 deviation.
10. **Immutable Events** — All operations that change material state (movements, adjustments, transfers, counts) MUST produce immutable event records, per ISA-95 operations event model.

### 1.1.6.1 Movement Reason Code Extensions

The `StockMovementReason` enum uses ISA-95 standard terminology directly. Each value maps 1:1 to an ISA-95 base movement type, with additional business-specific codes that extend the standard.

| WMS Reason Code | ISA-95 Base Type | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `Receipt` | Receipt | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type (inbound) |
| `Shipment` | Shipment | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type (outbound) |
| `Adjustment` | Adjustment | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type |
| `Transfer` | Transfer | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type |
| `CustomerReturn` | Receipt | Goods returned by customer (inbound receipt) |
| `SupplierReturn` | Shipment | Goods returned to supplier (outbound shipment) |
| `ProductionConsumption` | Production Consumption | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type |
| `ProductionOutput` | Production Output | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type |
| `WriteOff` | Adjustment | Irreversible loss — damage, expiry, theft |
| `CountAdjustment` | Count Adjustment | Direct 1:1 mapping to ISA-95 base type |
| `Other` | *(escape hatch)* | Edge cases not covered by specific codes; SHOULD be avoided in favor of specific codes |

**Note:** `ReasonCode` is stored as `StockMovementReason` enum (C#) with EF Core value conversion to `nvarchar(50)` in the database. `ReferenceType` is stored as `StockMovementReferenceType?` enum with the same pattern.

**Rationale:** Using ISA-95 standard terminology directly ensures unambiguous mapping and eliminates translation layers. Extended codes (CustomerReturn, SupplierReturn, WriteOff) preserve full traceability to ISA-95 base types while enabling domain-specific filtering and dashboards.

- **Spec:** `docs/infrastructure/SDD-AUTH-001-authentication-and-authorization.md`

---

## 6. Background Processing Architecture

None yet. Will be added as needed (e.g., Hosted Services for async processing).

---

## 7. External Integrations

- **Vue.js 3 SPA frontend** — consuming backend REST APIs (implemented)
- **ERP system** — planned, ISA-95 Part 4 information exchange (see Section 1.1.5)

---

## 7.1 Infrastructure (Phase 1.5 — Implemented)

### 7.1.1 Mandatory Infrastructure Rules for New Development

**These rules are MANDATORY. Violating them will create technical debt that blocks Phase 2.**

#### Redis Caching

-   **When to cache:** All lookup/reference data services (categories, UoM, permissions, roles) MUST cache their list endpoints via `IDistributedCache`.
-   **Pattern:** Cache the full unpaginated DTO list as a single JSON entry. Paginate from the cached list in memory. Invalidate on any write (create/update/delete).
-   **Cache key convention:** `{service}:{entity}:all` (e.g., `auth:permissions:all`, `inventory:product-categories:all`)
-   **TTL:** Permissions = 5 min, categories/UoM = 30 min. Transactional data (stock levels, movements) MUST NOT be cached.
-   **Extension method:** `services.AddWarehouseRedisCache(configuration)` — already called in Auth, Customers, Inventory `Program.cs`.
-   **Config key:** `ConnectionStrings:Redis` (defaults to `localhost:6379`)

| Service | Cache Key | TTL |
|---|---|---|
| PermissionService | `auth:permissions:all` | 5 min |
| ProductCategoryService | `inventory:product-categories:all` | 30 min |
| UnitOfMeasureService | `inventory:units-of-measure:all` | 30 min |
| CustomerCategoryService | `customers:customer-categories:all` | 30 min |

#### MassTransit Event Publishing

-   **When to publish:** All operations that change material state (movements, adjustments, transfers) and key business events (customer created) MUST publish a domain event via `IPublishEndpoint`.
-   **Event contracts:** Define as `sealed record` in `src/Warehouse.ServiceModel/Events/`. Use `required` properties.
-   **Event naming:** `{Entity}{PastTenseVerb}Event` (e.g., `StockMovementRecordedEvent`, `CustomerCreatedEvent`)
-   **Fire-and-forget:** Wrap `_publishEndpoint.Publish(...)` in try/catch — RabbitMQ unavailability MUST NOT break the main operation.
-   **Extension method:** `services.AddWarehouseMessageBus(configuration)` — already called in Customers, Inventory `Program.cs`. Add to new services that publish events.
-   **Config keys:** `RabbitMQ:Host`, `RabbitMQ:Username`, `RabbitMQ:Password`
-   **Testing:** Use `services.AddMassTransitTestHarness()` in integration test `ConfigureTestServices` to avoid real RabbitMQ connections.

| Event | Published From | After |
|---|---|---|
| `StockMovementRecordedEvent` | `StockMovementService.RecordAsync` | SaveChangesAsync |
| `InventoryAdjustmentAppliedEvent` | `InventoryAdjustmentService.ApplyAsync` | CommitAsync |
| `WarehouseTransferCompletedEvent` | `WarehouseTransferService.CompleteAsync` | CommitAsync |
| `CustomerCreatedEvent` | `CustomerService.CreateAsync` | SaveChangesAsync |

#### Polly Resilience (Phase 2 — when inter-service HTTP calls are introduced)

-   **When to use:** Every typed `HttpClient` that calls another microservice MUST use `AddWarehouseHttpClient<TClient, TImplementation>(baseAddress)`.
-   **What it includes:** Retry (3 attempts, exponential backoff + jitter), circuit breaker (5 min throughput, 15s break), 10s attempt timeout, 30s total timeout, correlation ID propagation.
-   **Current state:** No inter-service HTTP calls exist yet. Authentication uses JWT claims (no HTTP call to Auth.API). First use case: Phase 2 when Purchasing/Fulfillment call Inventory.
-   **Extension method:** `services.AddWarehouseHttpClient<TClient, TImpl>(baseAddress)` in `Warehouse.Infrastructure`.

#### Feature Flags

-   **When to use:** Gate any behavior that should be toggleable per environment: database seeding, new features during rollout, experimental endpoints.
-   **Flag constants:** Define in `src/Warehouse.Infrastructure/Configuration/FeatureFlags.cs` — never use magic strings.
-   **Config section:** `FeatureManagement` in `appsettings.json`. Flags default to `false` if not present — always add them to templates with explicit `true`/`false`.
-   **Extension method:** `services.AddWarehouseFeatureFlags()` — already called in Auth `Program.cs`. Add to new services that consume flags.
-   **Inject:** `IFeatureManager` into any service that needs flag checks.

| Flag | Service | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EnableDatabaseSeeding` | Auth.API | Gates entire `DatabaseSeeder.SeedAsync()` | `true` |
| `EnableSeedDefaultAdmin` | Auth.API | Gates default admin user creation | `true` |

#### Rate Limiting

-   Active on the Gateway. Global per-IP: 200 req/min. Named policy `"fixed"`: 100 req/min (for specific route assignment).
-   Returns `429 Too Many Requests` when exceeded.

## 8. Known Deviations from Persona Standards

| # | Deviation | Reason | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Nullable` enabled in `.csproj` | Default template setting | Review — may disable if not desired |
| 2 | `ImplicitUsings` enabled | Default template setting | Review — may disable for explicit control |
| 3 | Mapping project references both DBModel projects | Shared AutoMapper profiles | Split into per-domain mapping if isolation becomes critical |
| 4 | MassTransit events are fire-and-forget (try/catch) | No outbox pattern yet | Replace with MassTransit transactional outbox when Phase 2 workflows require guaranteed delivery |

---

## 9. Configuration Keys

| Key | Used By | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ConnectionStrings:WarehouseDb` | Auth, Customers, Inventory | — | SQL Server connection string |
| `ConnectionStrings:Redis` | Auth, Customers, Inventory | `localhost:6379` | Redis distributed cache |
| `Jwt:SecretKey` | All APIs | — | HMAC-SHA256 signing key (min 32 chars) |
| `Jwt:Issuer` | All APIs | `Warehouse.Auth.API` | JWT token issuer |
| `Jwt:Audience` | All APIs | `Warehouse` | JWT token audience |

| `RabbitMQ:Password` | Customers, Inventory | `warehouse` | RabbitMQ credentials |
| `OpenTelemetry:OtlpEndpoint` | All APIs, Gateway | `http://localhost:4317` | Jaeger OTLP endpoint |
| `FeatureManagement:EnableDatabaseSeeding` | Auth | `true` | Gate database seeder |
| `FeatureManagement:EnableSeedDefaultAdmin` | Auth | `true` | Gate admin user seed |
| `HealthChecks:AuthApi` | Gateway | `http://localhost:5001` | Auth health check URL (overridden in Docker) |
